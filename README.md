This is a repository holding files for a personal project involving my coke rewards codes. 
The history of this project predates me returning to school for a second degree in computer
science. While working on my first degree, I had worked at a oil change place near to school
where the entire staff would consume large amounts of canned and bottled beverages. I noticed
They were throwing away dozens of these away everyday so I began collecting them all into a 
separate bin and recycling them for money. My broke college ass found it pretty lucrative at
the time, as combined with the large amount of beer cans and bottles me and my roommates were
generated the recycling would generate about $80 every month. While removing the caps from the
bottles as required by the recycling facilities, I noticed that some of them had codes underneath.
I looked into what they were for and saw that they were redeemeed for points online which could
be used to buy things. Both Pepsi and Coke had similar programs at the time. So I started saving
the caps and redeeming them online. This wasn't as lucrative but led to getting free merchandise
like CDS off amazon or gift certificates for random places.

At some point it occurred to me that these codes are computer generated, and there must be some
sort of formula to generate them. So I began saving all the codes into a excel file. I'd often
find codes while jogging around town or just walking around so I would collect those as well 
and redeem them and add the data to the excel. Over time this excel grew to over a thousand
entries. I figured one day I would get around to learning to design a computer program to solve
the codes but never got around to it.

Fast forward 5 years or so and I decide to go back to school for computer science as it is 
a lucrative field and I don't see rapid growth at my current job/field. Additionally one of
my best friends at the time that worked at a rival bank had gone back to school to learn how
to program and was making over twice what he was making at the bank before. I finally have
the skillset to make use of this database that I've been building up over the years.

So this project is just trying to find what are the rules governing the generation of the
codes.
